The Eagle Park app is a web app that shows open parking spots on a college campus. This is intended to cover all of the commuter parking spots on campus. The can choose parking maps on the homepage or using the menu bar at the top of the website. Several unique features are included: the ability to see how long a spot has been taken, a timer for 15 min flasher spots, and lastly a feature for campus safety to “Login” to actively close spots or parking lots for maintenance/other reasons. The purpose of this app is to help commuting students find open parking as quickly and efficiently as possible.
